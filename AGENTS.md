# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.

## LarviFort CRM rules

- Kanban is server-driven: projects, columns, tasks, rules and automations come
  from the real API; no production fallback/mock data.
- Keep API contracts and normalization in `src/services`; components own
  presentation and user interaction.
- A new project may only render columns returned by the backend or explicitly
  created in the current form. Preserve form state on API errors.
- Run `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint` and `npm run build` before publishing.
